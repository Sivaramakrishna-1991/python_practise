Types of Recursion:

a. Head recursion: Here firstly the recursive calls happen and then printing takes place.

def headprint(n):
    if n == 0:
	return
    else:
	return headprint(n-1)
	print(n)

b. Tail recursion: Here firstly printing takes place and then recursive call will happen

def tailprint(n):
    if n == 11:
	return
    else:
	print(n)
	tailprint(n+1)

1. default recursion limit in python is usually set to a small value (10 ** 4), if we provide a large input to the recursive
function, a RecursionError will be raised
setrecursionlimit() function is sys module permits us to set the recursion limit. Once set to 10 ^ 6 large inputs
can be handled without any errors.
ex. sys.setrecursionlimit(10 ** 6)
