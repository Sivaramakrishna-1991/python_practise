from datatime ----> to perform conversions and airthmetic involving different units of time.
from datetime import timedelta --> to represent an interval of time. 
a = timedelta(days=2, hours=6)
b = timedelta(hours=4.5)
c = a + b
c.days
c.seconds
c.total_seconds()

from datetime import datetime
a = datetime(2012, 9, 23)
print(a) --> we can add timedetla instance here to this
b = datetime(2012, 12, 21) + c
d= b- a
d.days

now = datetime.today() --> prints the today date and current time --> datetime always aware of leap years.

dateutil module---? used for complex date manipulations, such as dealing with timezones, fuzzytime ranges, etc.

import datetime
from dateutil.relativedelta import relativedelta
print(datetime.timedelta(10))
a = datetime.datetime(2012, 3, 21)
print(a)
b = datetime.datetime(2012, 5, 4) + datetime.timedelta(30)
c = relativedelta(months=3)
print(a + c)
d = relativedelta(b, a)
print(d.days)
