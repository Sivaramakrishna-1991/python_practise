python operators
 	1. airthematic operators ( +, - , /, //, %, *, **)
	2. logical operators (and, or, not)
	3. comparison operators (>, <, >=, <=, ==)

EX:
print(int('1011', 2))  # convert binary to decimal
print(int('341', 8))   # convert octal to decimal
a = 3 + 4j
print(a.real)
print(a.imag)
a = 0o123 # octal value
b = 0b111 # binary value
c = 0xf  # hexa decimal value

and--> operator evaluates ALL expressions. It returns last expression if all all expressions evaluates to True.
       otherwise it returns the first value that evaluates to False.

or---> operator evalues ALL expressions and returns the first value that evaluates to True. Otherwise it returns
       last value that evaluates to False. 

pass--> statement is intened to do nothing on execution. Hence it is often called a no-op instruction. 

break --> terminates the loop without executing the else block. 

continue--> statement skips the rest of the statements in the block and continues with the next iteration of the
	    loop.
