All the exceptions are inherited by BaseException class --> exception --> 1. Standard Error 2. Warning

1. Standard Error --> EOFError, ZeroDivisionError, IndentationError
2. Warning --> DeprecatedWarning, ImportWarning

ex: 1
try:
	a, b = [int(x) for x in input("enter two numbers: ").split()]
	c = a / b
	print(c)
except ZeroDivisionError:
	print("Division by zero is not allowed, please enter non zero number")
print("This code after the exception")



finally--> whether an exception is occured or not, finally will execute, so we better to place close files, close
database connections in this block. 

ex: 2
try:
	f = open("myfile", "w")
	c = 5 / 0
	f.write("writing into file")
except:
	print("division by zero is not allowed")
else:
	print("only execute when there is no exception occured in the program")
finally:
	print("this is finally block")
	f.close()


else --> This block only execute when an exception is not occured in the program.
